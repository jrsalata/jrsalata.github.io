     <h1>How to deal with your </h1>
     <h2>Updated on January 1, 2019</h2>
     <h3>In effect until January 1, 2024 </br> or until the bro code committee makes a change</h3>

	<h3>Rules with bros and his/her significant other</h3>
     </br>
     <ul>
        <li>First and most important rule: <b>Brothers before lovers</b> </br>If you are the SO, do not hoard the bro away from his bros.  It will make you look like an enemy.  Uncool.</li>
        <li>Second: Anyone can be a persons bro, even of opposite gender.  Contrary to popular belief, men and women can be purely friends without any romantic feelings involved. So don't treat other women as threats</li>
        <li>Third: Sharing is caring.  As a bro, it is your duty to make sure your bro is happy.  So don't try to block your bros SO out completly.</li>
        <li>Fourth: Watch out for your bro.  If the relationship becomes toxic, you need to tell your bro 'bout it even if he wont like it</li>
        <li>Fifth: don't be a jerk.</li>
        
       
     </ul>
     <h3>Just no matter what, don't be a jerk and make sure to spend time with your bros.</h3>
