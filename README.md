## NOTE: This repo is mostly unused now.  Voluntold now has [its own repo](https://github.com/sheepman39/voluntold) along with a [template repo](https://github.com/sheepman39/voluntold).  
This code is extremely outdated and not representative of what I can do now.  I may fix most of it in the future.  

Note about this work: Most of the javascript is written using Khan Academy's special flavor of Processing Javascript and it can be a bit funky to deploy in a proper environment.  I plan on rewritting most of this with proper javascript, but I have not gotten around to it yet.  
If you enjoy the different projects here, great! If not, don't worry.  This is far from my greatest work.  If you wish to see some of my proper work, please feel free to contact me!

I also have a custom playlist generator based on the Groovy Bot (RIP) that is pretty nice

I have some other smaller projects on here that you can ignore
