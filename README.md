#I'm just trying to figure out how all of this works

So the main index file is a program called Voluntold for my Spanish class.  Pretty much it automatically selects a random student from a class and prevents it from being selected again until everyone is selected

I also have a custom playlist generator based on the Groovy Bot that is pretty nice

I have some other smaller projects on here that you can ignore
