#I'm just trying to figure out how all of this works

Note about this work: Most of the javascript is written using Khan Academy's special flavor of Processing Javascript and it can be a bit funky to deploy in a proper environment.  I plan on rewritting most of this with proper javascript, but I have not gotten around to it yet.  
If you enjoy the different projects here, great! If not, don't worry.  This is far from my greatest work.  If you wish to see some of my proper work, please feel free to contact me!

So the main index file is a program called Voluntold for my Spanish class.  Pretty much it automatically selects a random student from a class and prevents it from being selected again until everyone is selected.  
**NOTE: The version of voluntold in here is extremely outdated.  To see the dedicated repository for it, please go [here](https://github.com/sheepman39/voluntold)**

I also have a custom playlist generator based on the Groovy Bot that is pretty nice

I have some other smaller projects on here that you can ignore
