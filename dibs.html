     <h1>The Rules of Dibs vs. Debs</h1>
     <h2>Updated on January 1, 2019</h2>
     <h3>In effect until January 1, 2024 </br> or until the bro code committee makes a change</h3>

	<h3>The rules of dibs</h3>
     </br>
     <ul>
        <li>As a rule of thumb, “dibs” will always go to the person who “calls them” first.</li>
        <li>In order for it to be legally binding, you must say the full statement of what you call dibs on</li>
        <li>In order to be fair, a dibs will only last a week on a given object</li>
        <li>You must be in the same room or same conversation to call dibs.</li>
        <li>The statement, oral or written, must be complete without any mistakes or stuters to confirm the dibs</li>
        <li>Any mispelling or mispronounciation renders the dib useless</li>
     </ul>
     </br>
     <h3>Unknown to most people, there are also the rules of debs</h3>
     <h3>These rules are for those that do mispronounce/mispell 'dibs' and has a completly different set of rules and are as follows:</h3>
     <ul>
        <li>After a person calls 'debs' they waive the right to something if someone calls 'dibs' on it</li>
        <li>If no one counters the point of debs, then it will act as a normal dibs, but only last for a day</li>
        <li>If a person does call debs, then they are entitled to a joke</li>
     </ul>
