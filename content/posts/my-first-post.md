## Introduction
Hi! My name is John S and I am a Computer Science student that is passionate about learning new technologies and breaking down problems. I chose this field because I love problem solving and building solutions for them.  

For example, this page is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and I am currently following the guide for it to try and make myself a more professional portfolio/website on GitHub.
