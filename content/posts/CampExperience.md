For almost 10 years now, I was active in Scouting America (formerly the Boy Scouts of America) and had an experience like no other. It is where I learned how to be a cheerful servant leader, give back to my community, make connections, create visions and goals, and improvise solutions. As I slowly become less and less involved as I grow older, I am reminded of the importance of these lessons through my involvement on campus and in the professional world. I wanted to take some time and reflect on these lessons and how I apply them in new ways.
