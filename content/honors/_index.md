As a part of the Honors experience at IU Indy, each senior must create their own e-portfolio to showcase their work, learning, and progress.

We start this project in a class taken our freshman year called H200: Introduction to Honors. Its a fairly simple class that prepares us for all of the experiences we will have during our time at IU Indy.

Below are some different reflections, personal statements, and projects that best reflect some of my learning with respect to the Honors program.
