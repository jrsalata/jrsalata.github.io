# Who am I?

That really is the question that can sum up a great portion of our college expereinces. "Who am I?".

Finding yourself and recognizing growth can be difficult at times, especially when so much around us is changing faster than we can process. When I look at myself, there is so much I see and so much that I want to become.

During my freshman year, I wrote:

> I am a computer nerd that loves using the skills I learn to solve practical problems.  I enjoy camping and taking pictures of the outdoors.  I do my best to make healthy personal connections with those I meet and hear their stories.  I am ambitious and organized in my work.

The person that wrote that statement had no solid direction after graduation. He knew he just wanted to solve problems and help those around him.

He did not design a complex [assembler](/projects/assembler) to expand his problem solving skills. In fact, most of the techniques he would eventually used were incomprehensible at this time.

He did not understand just how powerful [automation tools](/posts/CognitiveAutomation) could be and how they unlocked a new type of problem solving.

He did not know how meaningful it can be to take on an internship at a consulting firm where the problems and people matter.

## Growth

How much has that simple "I am..." statement changed over the past four years? To be honest, not much. Fundamentally, I am still the same person that loves solving problems and connecting with people. But I will say that I understand more about my capabilities and what pushes me to do my absolute best. Many of my most difficult challenges gave me new appreciations for my interests.

I also think it is important to recognize my growth as a person outside of my field. I still believe that it is important to make personal connections with people. However, I learned how important it is to be empathetic and compassionate to those around me. Everyone has their own life with their own struggles. The least we should do is understand and support each other to the best of our abilities.

## I am...

When I look at everything I have gone through over these past four years, I am reminded of this simple line from Undertale by Toby Fox.

![Screenshot from undertale](/undertale.jpg)

> "Despite everything, it's still you." - Toby Fox.

In context of the game, there is a mirror close to the beginning of the game that reads "It's you!". As you travel through the world, you make lots of new friends and help those in need. The nicer you are, the harder the battles are for you. In one of the final sections of the game, you find an almost identical house with the same mirror with that simple line. You (as the character) grew so much it can be hard to remember how you started your journey. But despite all of that, it's still you on the inside and thats what matters.

Despite all of the late nights, difficult exams, and struggles with organization, it is still me at the core of it. I just gained a few layers on top from all of the lessons I've learned and challenges I overcame.

So who am I?

> I am a computer nerd that loves using the skills I learn to solve practical problems _for people_.  I enjoy camping and taking pictures of the outdoors _to capture moments that most of us miss_.  I do my best to make healthy personal connections with those I meet and hear their stories _to understand them better_.  I am ambitious and organized in my work _because I care about the work I do_. _I am someone who never wants to stop learning and growing because the world is constantly changing in new and exciting ways._

Nothing from my original statement was removed. Afterall, it is still me. But I added some details and refined who I am. Despite those additions, I don't think a single paragraph of statements and accurately describe anyone. There are many qualities of people that can not be captured by words or stories. Many qualities are better captured by one's actions and work rather than words on a page.

# Journey Map

Another assignment that I completed as a part of H200 was a simple journey map. The main goal was to go through our life and recognize significant portions of our life up to that point and plan for the future.

## Initial Map

Here is what I created during H200:
![JourneyMap.pdf](/JourneyMap.pdf)

Upon reflection, this journey map doesn't truly reflect my growth from that point. In fact, I wish I added more points to everything so there was more context. These are just a few points on my journey and they seem to hop from one to the other with little to no build up.

Furthermore, this style does not reflect my personality or professional brand. I hadn't really developed a solid sense of professional identity and I would want something that highlights my relevant abilities rather than a generic PowerPoint template.

## Updated Map

When recreating my journey map, I decided to start from scratch. Its a basic step diagram and I am very familiar with diagrams. I use diagrams when planning new projects, visualizing data structures, and designing systems architecture.

Another important detail to note about me: I am a bad digital designer. There are a million different tools out there to make diagrams and there is only one that I love to use: [mermaid.live](https://mermaid.live). Mermaid is completely text-based so you just type out the structure you need and its done. Theres no messing with weird lines, shapes, or configs.

I love text-centered tools because they are easy to save, share, edit, and configure. This website itself is nothing more than a bunch of fancy markdown files. The less I have to configure, the better.

Anyways, enough about my opinions on modern digital styling tools. Here is my updated journey map. [Skip to next section](#map-reflection)

## Map Reflection

Overall, I think that my overall goals and path have not significantly changed over the past few years. I was able to find real world experience opportunities where I gained new profesional skills and expanded my technical abilities.

I think the biggest change in this map - outside of the additional details and context - is my direction. I knew I wanted to build software and solve problems. I just wasn't sure the best way to do that. I think my expereince at Resultant helped me understand how impactful going into the consulting field can be. I can have the opportunity to work with multiple clients and gain experience with multiple different technologies.

Its easy to look at all of the growth I still need to accomplish. I do not know what I do not know about so many different fields. But this map allows me to see all of the progress I have made and how further I am compared to when I started.
