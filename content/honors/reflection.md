After going through all of the showcases and projects, I can't help but look back from where I started. I started this journey as a Freshman in 2022. I had a strong desire to learn and wanted to dive in on every project I could. I didn't know what I wanted to do exactly other than solve problems.

Now, I've gained some experience. I learned concepts and tools that younger me never would have known or thought about. I'm still curious and wanting to learn more but I also learned another important idea: you can't learn everything. The field of Computer Science covers so many subfields, ideas, and technologies that it would probably take multiple lifetimes to master them all. Instead of learning everything or spending my time learning one thing really well, I decided to try to dabble in a bit of everything. I want to be a jack of all trades and a master of none. If I can understand the fundamental concepts behind everything, then I can learn almost anything I need to in the future. With how dynamic the field is, learning how to learn new tools and technologies is critical to remain relevant.

> You can't learn everything

My time in the Honors college reinforced this with a few of the projects and experiences I completed. 

My [assembler](/honors/showcase2/), for example, was an application of thoery learned over two semesters. It implemented design patterns from my Principles of Software Design course and the theories that we were learning in Computer Structures. I used this as an opportunity to learn about test driven development and other automated build tools. Am I an expert in test driven development or build tools? No. But I can learn more when I need to.

One of my first projects was a simple package management system. You could log packages, pick them up, and mark their condition. When I built it, it took a lot of time and effort to get everything working. It was a bunch of new concepts that I was still learning about. 

Looking back, I see how much I've grown. What felt like a mountain of a project is now just a small hill. The more projects I complete, the more problems I overcome, the more mountains I climb, the easier the next one is and the harder future mountains can be.

This was especially true during my internship at Resultant. Everything I learned, developed, and struggled with gave me the determination, ambition, and willingness to learn what I needed. I specifically mention that the struggles I faced while learning in school because the biggest struggles lead to the most memorable and important lessons. Despite how dificult some of the challenges were, I never gave up and continued to learn and develop.

At Resultant, I worked with technologies and platforms I had no experience with. It was intimidating at first. I don't fully understand all of the details but I knew enough to know what I needed to learn. Every project from my simple package system to a complex assembler gave me the determination and wisdom to keep going and make an impact on the projects and teams I worked with.
