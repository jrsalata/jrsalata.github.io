These are some of the projects that I've worked on! I use each project as an opportunity to learn and apply new skills for a practical problem that I want to solve.

I am a problem solver and the tools I use are the frameworks and languages I write in. I try not to use one language for everything because that would be like using a hammer to screw something together. I use the right tool for the job.

This is not an exhaustive list of projects I've completed. However, I do plan on expanding this list soon.
