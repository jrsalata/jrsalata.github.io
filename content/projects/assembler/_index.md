The full story and journal is currently a work in progress. However, the documentation of everything is available [here](/docs/apidocs/index.html). The documentation was automatically generated using javadocs and there may be some typos and formatting issues as I am not the most familiar with it.  If you see an issue, please consider [submitting an issue](https://github.com/sheepman39/Assembler/issues) so I can fix it.  There is a lot and it is tricky to look over everything.
