This project was challenging for me in quite a few ways. For starters, I had to figure out a good design that would be flexible enough as more features would be added. Since each subsequent feature required thorough knowledge in order to properly implement, it was difficult to try and plan it all at once. The project started as soon as the class started, but we would not cover all of the needed topics until about halfway through the semester. I figured I should also expect for the structure to change in small ways so I should try and keep my code as modular as possible. That way, if I did need to move some logic around, I could simply cut and paste.
