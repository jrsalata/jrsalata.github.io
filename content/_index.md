# Welcome!

It is my goal that I will be able to build up this page to act as a professional journal/blog for myself.  I want a place to point people towards when they want to see my portfolio, resume, thoughts, and other personal items.  I hope to show off some of my work while also providing updates on different projects and the struggles I am overcoming.
