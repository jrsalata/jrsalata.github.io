Welcome to my personal site where I post small articles about the different projects I'm working on, tools I'm learning, or any other fun thoughts I have.  Right now, this site is a bit barren since it is relatively new, but I hope to build it up over the next few months with some previous projects and thoughts on the current state of technology.  In the meantime, feel free to check out each of the links below and let me know what your thoughts are.
