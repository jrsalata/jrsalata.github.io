Welcome to my personal site where I post small articles about the different projects I'm working on, tools I'm learning, or any other fun thoughts I have.  

This site focuses on the more technical side of myself and focuses heavily on projects, skills, and thoughts around technology. I encourage you to read around and explore some of my thoughts!
