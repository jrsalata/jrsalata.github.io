I am currently earning my degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Cognitive Automation. I chose to study CS because I love breaking down problems, building a solution, and learning ways to build better solutions.  I am motivated by solving real problems and a drive to constantly find ways to improve.

I hope to be a Software Developer after I graduate and work on robotic process automation (RPA) or backend development. I chose to specialize in Cognitive Automation because it is a whole new way to solve problems and complete tedious tasks. I like to think of myself as a lazy programmer in the way that I will spend an hour to learn a new tool or skill to save ten minutes of time.  Those small tools or skills usually end up being useful in other projects or situations.

Outside of my professional work, I am an enthusiast photographer that enjoys taking pictures at different events.  I love capturing moments, expressions, and experiences in a way that most people miss.  While everyone has a camera on their phone these days, very few people are intentional with how they take pictures.  I try to tell a story with my work where every detail matters. I might post some on here in the near future.
