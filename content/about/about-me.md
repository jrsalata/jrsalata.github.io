I am currently earning my degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Cognitive Automation. I chose to study CS because I love breaking down problems, building a solution, and learning ways to build better solutions.  I am motivated by solving real problems and a drive to constantly find ways to improve.

I hope to be a Software Developer after I graduate and work on robotic process automation (RPA) or backend development. I chose to specialize in Cognitive Automation because it is a whole new way to solve problems and complete tedious tasks.  

Outside of my professional work, I am an enthusiest photographer that enjoys taking pictures at different events.  I love capturing moments, expressions, and experiences in a way that most people miss.  While everyone has a camera on their phone these days, very few people are intentional with how they take pictures.
