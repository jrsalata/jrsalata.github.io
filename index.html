        <p class = "posts">So today we had a govert test on the Japanese theater in WW2.  It was surprisenly easy so the next test is going to be <strong>impossible</strong>.  Right now, everyone on Earth is deciding to debate and get angry with everyone over eachother's opinions. It is just a pointless debate that affects absolutley no one, so why are we causing social wars in an already tence environment.  There are only <em>8 days left of school!</em> Why can't we just live in peace?</p>
